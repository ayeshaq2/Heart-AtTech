# Heart At-Tech

## About

Heart AtTech is an application extension that, as a first step, allows CPR/AED certified individuals to sign up as voluntary first responders to emergency situations around their location. Once individuals sign up, their CPR/AED certification is verified against the organization that provided it, and they are provided with a first aid responder badge. It works as a 911 response alert, and is an add-on to the emergency response system already in place. The 911 call staff asks the caller to accept a location request to be sent to a CPR-certified volunteer. Once the caller accepts the request, volunteers within a certain radius of the caller are sent a notification alert to respond to the 911 call, which they choose to accept. If accepted, they are sent the location of the caller and the AEDs around. This reduces the average response time to CPR-related emergencies, reducing the need of medical facilities that may not be readily available at the time.

## Development Overview

The designing was done using Figma, with which we created the final look of the Heart AtTech mobile app. The webapp was built using React.js, with aesthetics built with HTML and CSS. We used Firebase for building our database that stores the 911 calls with relevant location and responder information.
